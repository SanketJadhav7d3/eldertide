# ⚔️ Tiny Swords ⚔️

Hark, brave commander! A shadow falls upon your peaceful village. The goblin hordes are on the march, their crude banners blotting out the sun. They come with clanking metal, wicked bombs, and... exploding barrels? It's up to you to rally your people, build a mighty fortress, and lead your tiny army to a massive victory!

## The Goal

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build, gather, and fight your way through **five waves** of increasingly grumpy goblins. Protect your castle, manage your resources, and show them the pointy end of your tiny swords!

## Meet Your Crew

Lead a small but determined force of loyal subjects:

*   **👷 The Worker:** The backbone of your village! These tireless folks chop wood, shear sheep (aggressively), mine gold, and build everything you need. They're smart, too—once they start a job, they'll keep at it until the resource is gone or you give them a new order!
*   **🛡️ The Warrior:** Your bread-and-butter brawler. Give 'em a sword, point 'em at a goblin, and watch the sparks fly.
*   **🐴 The Lancer:** With a longer reach and a powerful poke, Lancers are perfect for breaking enemy lines and keeping threats at a distance.
*   **🏹 The Archer:** Why get your hands dirty? Archers rain pointy death from afar, perfect for picking off those pesky bombers before they get too close.

## Build Your Kingdom

A strong village is the key to victory. Place these structures to grow your power:

*   **🏰 The Castle:** Your home base. Protect it at all costs! It's also where you'll train more Workers to expand your glorious empire.
*   **⚔️ The Barracks:** This is where brave villagers become Warriors and Lancers. A must-have for any aspiring warlord.
*   **🎯 The Archery Range:** Turn your citizens into keen-eyed Archers. Essential for a balanced and deadly fighting force.
*   **🗼 The Tower:** A sturdy defensive structure to help fend off the green tide.

## Know Your Enemy

The goblin army is as varied as it is unpleasant:

*   **👺 Goblin:** Numerous, nasty, and not very bright. What they lack in strength, they make up for in sheer numbers.
*   **💣 Bomber:** A glass cannon with a wicked arm. This ranged menace lobs bombs that can devastate your clustered units. Take them out FAST.
*   **💥 Barrel:** It's a goblin... carrying a barrel... that's on fire. **DO NOT** let this reach your army or buildings. You've been warned.
